# AIUB-CGPA-Calculator
## Saw many of my juniors asking how to calculate CGPA beforehand correctly which I also used to ask back in my fresher days, this is plain Simple CGPA Calculator solving this particular problem.
- No extra work,
- No one by one course input,
- No individual course stuff,
- Just major info input and CGPA/GPA output.

## Intructions:
- Go to your Grade Reports BySemester page in AIUB Portal.
- Count how many times each individual (A+ to F) grades you got.
- Count how many credits each grade has total. (1/2/3 credit).
- Enter the values in their place. (Leave empty will be handled automatically).
- Press Calculate CGPA and see the result.
