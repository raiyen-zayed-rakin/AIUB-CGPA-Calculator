# AIUB-CGPA-Calculator
## Saw many of my juniors asking how to calculate CGPA beforehand correctly which I also used to ask back in my fresher days, this is plain Simple CGPA Calculator solving this particular problem.
- No extra work,
- No one by one course input,
- No individual course stuff,
- Just major info input and CGPA/GPA output.
